    "        * **Size:** (Provide an estimated size relative to the image frame if possible, or describe as small/large)\n",

      "Summary: Vitiligo (, vi-ti-leye-goh) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or color. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it may be related to immune system changes, genetic factors, stress, or sun exposure. Treatment options include topical medications, light therapy, surgery and cosmetics. The condition can show up on any skin type as a light peachy color and can appear on any place on the body in all sizes. The spots on the skin known as vitiligo are also able to “change” as spots lose and regain pigment; they will stay in relatively the same areas but can move over time and some big patches can move through the years but never disappear overnight.\n",

Voiced by Gary Anthony Williams, he first appeared on television in the show's pilot episode on November 6, 2005. Created and designed by cartoonist Aaron McGruder, Ruckus gained substantial popularity after appearing in the 1996 comic strip of the same name.\n",
      "Ruckus had a turbulent childhood being raised by his abusive father, Mr. Ruckus, whose abuse is the reason Ruckus has a mismatched left eye. His mother, Bunny Ruckus had an identity crisis which often led her to criticize fellow African-American people and have a high opinion of white Americans. After being kicked out of his home as a child, he traveled to Woodcrest where he worked 47 odd jobs.\n",
      "He embodies many old American working-class stereotypes, as he is crude, short-tempered, obese, clumsy, rule-breaking, and a jack of all trades. One of his most notable traits is his internalized racism; he is an outspoken white supremacist and even claims to be an Irish-American who suffers from \"reverse vitiligo”.\n",
      "In spite of this, Ruckus maintains a close relationship with Robert Freeman and yearns for social acceptance. Despite the blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including work as a recording artist.\n",

This is then followed, days to weeks later, by an eruption of many smaller scaly spots; pinkish with a red edge in people with light skin and greyish in darker skin. About 20% of cases show atypical deviations from this pattern. It usually lasts less than three months and goes away without treatment. Sometimes malaise or a fever may occur before the start of the rash or itchiness, but often there are few other symptoms.\n",
      "While the cause is not entirely clear, it is believed to be related to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) or human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7). It does not appear to be contagious. Certain medications may result in a similar rash. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.\n",
      "Evidence for specific treatment is limited. About 1.3% of people are affected at some point in time. It most often occurs in those between the ages of 10 and 35. The condition was described at least as early as 1798.\n",

Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks (a condition known as chronic urticaria). The condition frequently recurs.\n",
      "Hives frequently occur following an infection or as a result of an allergic reaction such as to medication, insect bites, or food. Psychological stress, cold temperature, or vibration may also be a trigger. In half of cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma. Diagnosis is typically based on appearance. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy.\n",
      "Prevention is by avoiding whatever it is that causes the condition. Treatment is typically with antihistamines, with the second generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine, loratadine and cetirizine being preferred due to less risk of sedation and cognitive impairment. In refractory (obstinate) cases, corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors may also be used. Keeping the environmental temperature cool is also useful. For cases that last more than six weeks, long-term antihistamine therapy is indicated. Immunosuppressants such as omalizumab or cyclosporin may also be used.\n",

Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks. The condition frequently recurs. In half of cases of hives, the cause remains unknown.

Typically it results in a red, itchy, scaly, circular rash. Hair loss may occur in the area affected. Symptoms begin four to fourteen days after exposure. The types of dermatophytosis are typically named for area of the body that they affect. Multiple areas can be affected at a given time.\n",
      "About 40 types of fungus can cause dermatophytosis. They are typically of the Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton type. Risk factors include using public showers, contact sports such as wrestling, excessive sweating, contact with animals, obesity, and poor immune function. Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms. It may be confirmed by either culturing or looking at a skin scraping under a microscope.\n",
      "Prevention is by keeping the skin dry, not walking barefoot in public, and not sharing personal items. Treatment is typically with antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole. If the scalp is involved, antifungals by mouth such as fluconazole may be needed.\n",
      "Dermatophytosis has spread globally, and up to 20% of the world's population may be infected by it at any given time. Infections of the groin are more common in males, while infections of the scalp and body occur equally in both sexes. Infections of the scalp are most common in children while infections of the groin are most common in the elderly. Descriptions of ringworm date back to ancient history.\u001b[0m\n",
